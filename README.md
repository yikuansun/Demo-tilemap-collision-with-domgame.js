# Demo tilemap collision with domgame.js
A demonstration of tilemap collision with domgame.js. Uses <a href="https://github.com/yikuansun/domgame.js">domgame.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yikuansun/Alternative-collision-script-for-domgame.js">the alternative collision script for domgame.js</a>.

# Why?
In my <a href="https://github.com/yikuansun/Scrolling-platformer-demo-with-domgame.js">demo scrolling platformer</a>, the speed of the collision detection script would vary directly with the number of tiles in the level. With this method, however, the speed of the collision detection script will remain constant no matter how large the level. This is vital for game development, in which efficiency plays a huge role.
